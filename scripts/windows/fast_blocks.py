"""Prepaid copies of eligible translated blocks.

  fast_blocks.py COMPOSITE_SRC [--lean]

Each block the translator emits starts by asking whether it can charge all its
cycles now (dolrecomp_block_can_precharge: the next deadline is further than
the block). It almost always can, but every instruction still carries the
machinery for when it cannot: its pc stored, a test of cycle_block_prepaid
that would charge it alone, the observation suffix chosen between its prepaid
value and 0. In integer code that is as many host instructions as the guest
instruction itself.

This gives each block a second copy, entered right after the block's start has
charged it all (cycle_block_prepaid true), in which
  - the per-instruction prepaid tests are gone (each is false there),
  - each suffix is its prepaid value,
  - every original pc store remains, including those in arithmetic-only
    instructions, so host observations keep the original guest pc,
  - a block that can refund cycles or otherwise change its prepaid state
    keeps its original body without a copy,
  - the labels are the original block's (a jump from the copy goes where the
    same jump from the block goes), and the end continues where the block ends.
Everything else is the block's own text. Only blocks that remain prepaid
throughout get copies; unsupported forms retain their original bodies.

--lean is Elliott Tate's original transform (imported in 0db6d35, made
conservative in 42af7ac), the one Wind Waker Recomp's builds use: it copies
every block it can read, refund blocks included, and an instruction that calls
nothing does not store its pc (nothing can read it before the next store; the
copy stores the last one it skipped before it leaves). A deadline refund does
as before and then continues in the original block at the next instruction.
It differs from the conservative form in when interrupts land by a few cycles,
so it fails the strict boot-route comparison (docs/PERFORMANCE.md, phase 4); it
is for measured, opt-in builds (--lean-blocks).

The change is repeatable (a prepared chunk is left as it is) and keeps LF line
ends. Prepare mod variants first and run this before recording the final
generated-source digest. This generic transform accepts the ordinary pointer
state chunks; it does not require fixed-register or native replacements.
Qualification is manual until correctness and matched performance are accepted.
