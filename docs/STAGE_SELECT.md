# The developers' stage select

Wind Waker still has the menu its developers used to jump to any room: 40 lines covering every dungeon,
island, sea square, interior and 48 cutscenes, 468 places in all. Nothing in the finished game opens it.
BlueWake can, in English, from your own loaded file, so Link arrives with your hearts, items and boat.

It is a developer tool and off unless you turn it on. It changes no game code; it only steers the game's
own scene changes and writes English over the menu's Japanese text while the menu is open.

## Turning it on

In the settings (F1): **Developers' stage select (F7)**, under **Gameplay** on Mac and Linux and under
**Mods** on Windows. It's off by default and takes effect the next time BlueWake starts.

The Linux and Windows builders put the English names in a `stage_select` folder beside the app, and
BlueWake finds them there. On a Mac, set `BLUEWAKE_STAGE_SELECT_NAMES=<repository>/config/stage_select`
for them; without it the menu shows its Japanese names.

`BLUEWAKE_STAGE_SELECT=1` in the environment still turns it on, whatever the toggle says, so existing
launch commands and `.bat` files keep working.

Then:

- **Hold R while starting a file** (from choosing the quest log until the screen fades): the stage select
  opens instead of your save point. Without R the file loads as usual.
- **F7 during play** opens it from wherever you are. **F7 in the menu** takes you back: to the entrance
  of the room you were in, with your time of day and day of the week. The game does not keep Link's exact
  position.
- **On a controller**, Back (View on Xbox, Share or Create on PlayStation, ⧉ on the Steam Deck) opens
  BlueWake's settings, and the button under the stage select's toggle does what F7 does: **Go to the stage
  select** in play, **Back to where I was** in the menu. Before a file has started it is greyed out: hold R
  as you start one instead.

The stage select is in the desktop apps (Mac, Linux, Windows and the Steam Deck). The iPhone and iPad app
doesn't have it.

## Controls

The menu lists them on screen.

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad Up/Down | Pick a line |
| A / B | Next / previous room on that line |
| R / L | Choose a different spawn point in the room (only ones the room has) |
| X / Y | Time of day: normal, fast, morning, noon, evening, night, or a fixed hour |
| D-pad Left/Right | Day of the week |
| Z | Which half of the story Link's cutscene animations are set for: before or after the Helmaroc King fight |
| Start | Go |

## Notes on the names

Some names end in a note:

- **(before)** and **(after)**: the cutscene needs Link's cutscene animations from before or after the
  Helmaroc King fight at the Forsaken Fortress, where the game switches sets. (The menu's bottom line says
  "before rescue" and "after rescue": the flag is set at the end of Aryll's rescue, and the next scene,
  the fight, loads the second set.) The game keeps only one set loaded (`/res/Object/LkD00.arc` or
  `LkD01.arc`, chosen by story flag 0x2D01), and playing a cutscene from the other half crashes. Every
  cutscene on the Cutscenes line is marked, by where it falls in the story (ZeldaSpeedRuns' "Flags and
  Triggers" page lists which cutscenes use which set). Press Z until the line at the bottom says the right
  half. This is the developers' own "demo 23" switch (controller 3's A in the original menu). It sets a
  real story flag, so put it back before you save a real file.
- **(crash)**: the place's default spawn point crashes when started cold (Wind Temple R04 and R08: the
  room's doors ask about Link before he is fully created). Pick another spawn point with R/L.
- **(hangs)**: a developer test room that loads but never lets Link in.

## For tests and benchmarks

The same mechanism can skip the menu entirely. With these set, BlueWake starts a quest log by itself and
goes straight to a place:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `BLUEWAKE_WARP` | `stage:room:point[:layer]` (the game's own codes, for example `Siren:0:0`), a menu line and room (`6.0`), or a name from the names files (`Valoo roars`). A name that fits several rooms lists them and goes nowhere. |
| `BLUEWAKE_WARP_FILE` | `1`, `2` or `3`: press A for you until that quest log starts. An empty log stops it. |
| `BLUEWAKE_WARP_TIME` | `0`–`23`, or `morning`, `noon`, `evening`, `night` |
| `BLUEWAKE_WARP_STOP_AFTER` | End the run that many play frames after Link appears (for sweeping many places) |

Every place in the menu was warped to this way, headless, on Windows, from a late-game file: 451 of 468
arrive. The rest are the places with notes above, plus a few that crash at `pc=0x8180FFF0` through a host
bug in how a finished disc read calls back into the game. A given build crashes the same way every time,
but which places it hits moves when the host code changes; it needs its own fix.

## Names files

`config/stage_select/` holds three, loaded in order; a later file replaces the names of the rooms it
covers and keeps everything else:

1. `names.tsv`: our own names, each line's place (stage, room, spawn point, layer), the room's spawn
   points, and the notes.
2. `names-randomizer.tsv`: dungeon rooms named after their Wind Waker Randomizer item locations (MIT,
   see `NOTICE-randomizer`).
3. `names-decomp.tsv`: other rooms named after the actors in them, from the zeldaret/tww decompilation.

A name is at most 31 letters; the menu shortens long ones to fit the screen next to their line's name.
