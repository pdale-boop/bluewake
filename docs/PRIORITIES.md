# BlueWake priorities

The ranked backlog and the evidence behind it. What is being done on which day is in [GOAL_LOOP.md](GOAL_LOOP.md);
this page says what comes next and why. Owner: Chris. Updated October 11, 2026. The October 8 version, with the
0.6.0 tables and full evidence, is kept in [status/PRIORITIES_2026-10-08.md](status/PRIORITIES_2026-10-08.md).

## How it's ordered

1. **Bugs that break the game first:** a crash, a soft lock, a controller that can't play, missing sound or drawing,
   or a regression in the current release.
2. **Performance next:** low and uneven frame rates are the loudest complaint, on every platform.
3. **Everything else after:** narrower bugs, then features, then new platforms.

Within a tier, what reaches the most players with the clearest fix goes first. A new crash or data-loss report goes
straight to the top. Keep the states apart: *suspected*, *cause found*, *fixed in main*, *shipped*, *confirmed*. Close
an issue only when its reporter confirms, or it is a clear duplicate.

## The list

| # | What | Issues | State | Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Speed: the host's per-call work.** LiquidAzir's profile on the Fold 7 ([#93](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/93)): per retrace the host and runtime cost 40 M instructions in BlueWake against 7 M in Wind Waker Recomp's build; `host_direct_can_skip` alone is 23 M. The game thread is the limit on every slow CPU, from a 2-core laptop to the Steam Deck | [#59](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/59), [#137](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/137), [#159](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/159), [#86](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/86), [#215](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/215), [#246](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/246), [#93](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/93) | 0.7.0 shipped lean blocks, hidden symbols (Linux) and draw fusion (Windows). [#242](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/242) (pdale-boop) merged October 11: the per-block checks do less, 7% fewer instructions, 5 to 8% faster on slow x86 CPUs, identical game state | The phone and the Deck remeasured on `main`; then the host keeps one "may skip" flag current that the module reads inline ([GOAL_LOOP.md](GOAL_LOOP.md) row 0) |
| 2 | Clouds, distant waves and fog flicker at 60 and 120 FPS on NVIDIA, new in 0.5.0 | [#136](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/136) | Suspected. Clean at 30 FPS, so in Smooth Motion's in-between frames. Both earlier switches (`DOL_AURORA_INTERP_ALL_VERTICES`, `DOL_GX_TRANSFORM_VERIFY`) still flicker on 0.7.0 (Muyfa666), so patches 0152 and 0155 are not the cause | A run with `DOL_AURORA_UBERSHADER=0` and a 120 FPS session log; then compare 0.4.0's Smooth Motion with 0.5.0's |
| 3 | **Linux as a download.** 0.7.0 builds and plays from source (two laptops, a Steam Deck, a Gentoo desktop) | [#56](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/56), [#203](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/203), [#215](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/215) | The AppImage still needs a contributor's own-disc build. Draw fusion on for Linux, merged in [#247](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/247) (jkoehler11's Deck run: a tenth of the draws, the GX worker 45% to 24%, nothing missing) | cforain builds the AppImage, from `c6094ec` for 0.7.0 or from the next release commit; the release check; Chris adds it |
| 4 | **Android at the iPhone app's standard.** Builds from your own disc and plays; the ⋯ menu, touch, controllers, saves, texture packs and folding are all checked on a Fold 7 | [#75](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/75), [#93](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/93), [#238](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/238) | Up to date with 0.7.0. Speed is the only gate left: Outset at 67 to 80% when cool (172 M a retrace against 110 M), against "holds 30" | LiquidAzir merges `main` ([#242](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/242)), turns hidden symbols off for Android (9 M more on ARM64), measures the pier; merged as "build it yourself, experimental" when Outset holds 30. [#238](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/238): the screen recorder loses the Vulkan device |
| 5 | **The crash sweep and benchmark tour:** warp to all 468 places on every release candidate; one command that measures a build at fixed spots | none | The stage select and `BLUEWAKE_WARP` are in `main` ([#210](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/210), merged October 11, no cost when off) | The sweep on the next candidate; `bench_tour.py` on `BLUEWAKE_WARP` |
| 6 | **Speed, horizon 2:** lighter timing, natives that remove round trips (round 4, 5 and 7, re-certified on a lean build), cached display lists, the graphics thread on four-core CPUs | [#86](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/86), [#179](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/179) | Planned | 0.8 |
| 7 | **Releases without game code:** a maintainer-trained profile, then a first-launch build with a progress screen ([DIRECTION.md](DIRECTION.md#1-no-game-code-in-any-release)) | none | Not started | After the speed work settles the build options |
| 8 | Older single reports: a Forsaken Fortress soft lock, the pirate flag's missing texture, the Pictobox's stale photo fix on by default | [#76](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/76), [#69](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/69), #13 | Unverified, needs info, opt-in | Reproduce from a copied save; a physical iPad for #13 |
| 9 | **Features,** in order: Swap L and R ([#248](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/248), merged), the D-pad in the item screens, gyro aiming, a controller picker, HD textures from the menu, Elliott's HD renderer work, ultrawide, Wind Waker HD options, a mod folder, a graphics hotkey | [#244](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/244), [#245](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/245), [#188](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/188), [#155](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/155), [#70](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/70), [#152](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/152), [#108](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/108) | Requests; [#244](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/244) is in `main` | After the speed work, except small ones like [#244](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/244) |
| 10 | iPhone and iPad builds from Windows through PadMint | [#100](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/100), [#46](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/pull/46) | Parked drafts | A maintainer decision |

Not planned now: the European and Japanese discs ([#60](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/60)), Intel Macs ([#48](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/48)), Switch ([#62](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/62)), the Wii U-style
interface ([#57](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/57)). CPUs without AVX2 get a clear message and no build ([#77](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/bluewake/issues/77)).

## Waiting on someone else
